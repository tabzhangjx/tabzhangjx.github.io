Graph regression is a fundamental task that has gained significant attention in various graph learning tasks. However, 
the inference process is often not easily interpretable. Current explanation techniques are limited to understanding GNN 
behaviors in classification tasks, leaving an explanation gap for graph regression models. In this work, we propose a 
novel explanation method to interpret the graph regression models (XAIG-R). Our method addresses the distribution shifting 
problem and continuously ordered decision boundary issues that hinder existing methods away from being applied in 
regression tasks. We introduce a novel objective based on the information bottleneck theory and a new mix-up framework, 
which could support various GNNs in a model-agnostic manner. Additionally, we present a contrastive learning strategy to 
tackle the continuously ordered labels in regression tasks. We evaluate our proposed method on two benchmark datasets and
a real-life dataset introduced by us, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in interpreting GNN models 
in regression tasks.
