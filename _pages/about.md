I'm Jiaxing Zhang, a P.hD. student at New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
I obtained my bachelor's degree in Honoured Science Program (computer science) from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2020. 
I’m currently doing my P.hD. study, (co-)supervised by [Prof. Hua Wei@ASU](https://www.public.asu.edu/~hwei27/) and [Prof. Michael Lee@NJIT](https://people.njit.edu/profile/mjlee). 
My research focuses on data mining (Explainable AI, Graph Neural Network and Information Bottleneck), deep learning 
(Large Language Model), and natural language processing (code analysis).

I'm actively looking for an internship/full-time job from 2024 Summer to 2025 Spring.
