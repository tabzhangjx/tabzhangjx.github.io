I'm Jiaxing Zhang, a P.hD student at New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2020. 
I’m currently doing my phd study, (co-)supervised by Prof. Hua Wei@ASU and Prof. Michael Lee@NJIT. 
My research focuses on data mining (Explainable AI, Graph Neural Network and Information Bottleneck), deep learning (Large Language Model), and natural language processing (code analysis).

I'm actively looking for an internship currently.
